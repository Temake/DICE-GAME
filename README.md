# Dice Game 🎲

A simple, fun two-player dice game where two players roll dice, and the player with the higher number wins! The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and has features like sound effects, animations, and score tracking.

## 📝 How the Game Works:
1. Click the "Roll Again" button to roll the dice for both Player 1 and Player 2.
2. The dice will generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each player.
3. The player with the higher number wins, and the winner is announced on the screen.
4. If both players roll the same number, it results in a tie.
5. The score for each player is tracked and displayed under the player's dice.

## 🌟 Features:
- **Neon Styling:** The game has a modern look with a black background and neon-colored text.
- **Animated Win Message:** When a player wins, the result glows with a neon animation.
- **Sound Effects:** A sound plays when a player wins to make the game more engaging.
- **Score Tracking:** Scores for both players are displayed and updated after each round.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
